//  Callback functions are used for Asynchronous events. Whenever any asynchronous
//  event has to be done it is generally preferred to use callbacks (if data is not nested or inter-dependent).

//  What are Promises?
//  A promise is basically an advancement of callbacks in Node.  
//  In other words, a promise is a JavaScript object which is used to handle all the asynchronous data operations.
//  While developing an application you may encounter that you are using a lot of nested callback functions. 


// # KEY NOTE
// It’s recommended to use for..of loop if it is required to wait for each promise to complete or to run the asynchronous operations sequentially for each item.
// map, forEach these will not stop for another iteration. but for..of will stop

// All these methods take array of promises as an input but deals differently with respect to their behavior.
// Promise.all()
// Promise.allSettled()
// Promise.race()
// Promise.any()

console.log("=============== [ Promise.allSettled() ] ===============")
// he Promise.allSettled method is used to handle multiple promises concurrently, just like Promise.all, 
// but it waits for all the promises to settle (either resolve or reject) before proceeding. 
// It returns an array of objects representing the outcomes of the input promises, 
// including their values or reasons for rejection.

// Promise.allSettled() always returns array of objects with status key which denotes fulfilled or rejected.
//  If a promise is fulfilled then you can get response with value key and if the promise is rejected 
// then you can find the reason in reason key.

console.log("=============== [ Promise.race() ] ===============")

// As the name suggests, race returns first promise with shortest delay whether it is resolved or rejected.

// For example if there are 5 promises which returns result like this:
// Promise 1 ==> 1 second (rejected)
// Promise 2 ==> 2 seconds (rejected)
// Promise 3 ==> 3 seconds (resolved)
// Promise 4 ==> 4 seconds (resolved)
// Promise 5 ==> 5 seconds (resolved)

// Output 1 -
// First promise resolved: Promise 2 resolved


// NOTE :  Please note: race does not care if all are resolved or all are rejected. 
// It will give you first settled result whether it is resolved or rejected.

console.log("=============== [ Promise.any() ] ===============")

// It is somewhat similar to race method but with few minor differences:

// It will return with first resolved promise.
// For example if there are 5 promises which returns result like this:
// Promise 1 ==> 1 second (rejected)
// Promise 2 ==> 2 seconds (rejected)
// Promise 3 ==> 3 seconds (resolved)
// Promise 4 ==> 4 seconds (resolved)
// Promise 5 ==> 5 seconds (resolved)

// So, it will return us Promise 3 because it was the first one being resolved.

// If all promises are rejected, it will give you an aggregated error.
// For example if there are 5 promises which returns result like this:
// Promise 1 ==> 1 second (rejected)
// Promise 2 ==> 2 seconds (rejected)
// Promise 3 ==> 3 seconds (rejected)
// Promise 4 ==> 4 seconds (rejected)
// Promise 5 ==> 5 seconds (rejected)

// So, now it will return an aggregated result like this:

// [AggregateError: All promises were rejected]
